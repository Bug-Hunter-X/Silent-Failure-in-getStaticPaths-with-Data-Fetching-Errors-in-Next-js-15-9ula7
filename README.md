# Silent Failure in Next.js 15's `getStaticPaths`

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15's `getStaticPaths` function. When data fetching within `getStaticPaths` throws an error, Next.js may not handle it gracefully, leading to a silent failure.  There's no clear error message indicating the problem.  This makes debugging difficult.

## The Bug

The core issue lies in how errors are handled during the asynchronous data fetching within `getStaticPaths`.  If a network error or any other exception occurs, the error is not properly propagated and the application continues without any warning, potentially resulting in missing pages or unexpected behavior.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe that the problematic page does not render correctly, but no error is thrown to help with debugging.

## Solution

The solution involves using try...catch blocks to handle potential errors within the asynchronous operations in `getStaticPaths`.  This allows for proper error handling and provides feedback to the developer, aiding in debugging.
