In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using `getStaticPaths` with dynamic routes and data fetching.

The code below demonstrates this scenario where the data fetching within `getStaticPaths` fails due to network error or other unforeseen reasons. The problem is that the error is not propagated to the client.
